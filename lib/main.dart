/// Entry point for the Unicode Flutter App.
///
/// This file serves as the main entry point for the Flutter application.
/// It initializes the application, sets up dependency injection, storage,
/// and BLoC observers, and launches the main app widget with proper
/// configuration for routing, theming, and state management.
///
/// The main function performs several critical initialization steps:
/// 1. Sets up the global BLoC observer for debugging
/// 2. Initializes the Rust library for Unicode operations
/// 3. Sets up persistent storage using Hive
/// 4. Launches the main app with proper configuration
///
/// Key Features:
/// - Global BLoC observer for comprehensive logging
/// - Rust library initialization for Unicode processing
/// - Persistent storage setup with Hive database
/// - Responsive framework integration
/// - BLoC providers for state management
/// - Custom theming and styling
/// - Auto-route configuration for navigation
///
/// Architecture:
/// - MainApp: Root widget with routing and theming
/// - MultiBlocProvider: Provides BLoCs to the widget tree
/// - ResponsiveBreakpoints: Handles different screen sizes
/// - AppRouter: Manages navigation between screens

/// Main entry point for the application.
///
/// This function performs all necessary initialization steps before
/// launching the Flutter app. It sets up global configurations,
/// initializes external libraries, and prepares the app for operation.
///
/// Initialization Steps:
/// 1. BLoC Observer: Sets up global logging and debugging
/// 2. Rust Library: Initializes the dart_icu4x library for Unicode operations
/// 3. Storage: Sets up Hive database for persistent data storage
/// 4. App Launch: Runs the main app widget
///
/// Error Handling:
/// - All initialization steps are wrapped in try-catch blocks
/// - Graceful fallbacks for failed initialization
/// - Comprehensive logging for debugging
///
/// Dependencies:
/// - flutter_bloc: For state management
/// - dart_icu4x: For Unicode character processing
/// - hive_flutter: For persistent storage
/// - responsive_framework: For responsive design

/// This widget serves as the main container for the entire application.

///
/// Key Responsibilities:
/// - Routing: Configures AutoRoute for navigation
/// - Theming: Applies custom theme and styling
/// - State Management: Provides BLoCs to the widget tree
/// - Responsiveness: Handles different screen sizes
/// - Navigation: Sets up the app router configuration
///
/// Widget Structure:
/// - MaterialApp.router: Main app container with routing
/// - ResponsiveBreakpoints: Handles responsive design
/// - MultiBlocProvider: Provides state management
/// - Unfocus: Handles input field focus management
///
/// BLoC Providers:
/// - UnicodeCharPropertiesBloc: Manages Unicode character data
/// - SavedCharactersCubit: Manages saved/favorite characters
/// - AllRecentCharactersCubit: Manages recently viewed characters
