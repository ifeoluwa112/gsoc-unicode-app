/// A widget that displays a Unicode character tile with comprehensive
/// information.
///
/// The CharacterTile widget is a reusable component that displays a single
/// Unicode character along with its name, code point, and script information.
/// It's designed to be used in lists and grids where users can browse and
/// select Unicode characters for further exploration or saving.
///
/// The widget automatically applies appropriate font styling based on the
/// character's script, ensuring proper rendering of multilingual content.
/// It also provides visual feedback for selection states and supports
/// touch interactions for user engagement.
///
/// Key Features:
/// - Displays character symbol with script-appropriate font
/// - Shows character name and Unicode code point
/// - Supports selection state with visual highlighting
/// - Responsive layout that adapts to content
/// - Touch interaction with callback support
/// - Automatic font selection based on script
///
/// Usage:
/// ```dart
/// CharacterTile(
///   character: 'ðŸ˜€',
///   characterName: 'GRINNING FACE',
///   codePoint: 'U+1F600',
///   script: 'Emoji',
///   onTap: () => handleCharacterTap(),
///   isSelected: false,
/// )
/// ```

/// Displays a tile for a Unicode character with comprehensive information.
///
/// This widget represents a single Unicode character in a list or grid
/// format. It displays the character symbol, name, code point, and script
/// information in a clean, organized layout that's easy to read and
/// interact with.
///
/// The widget automatically selects the most appropriate font for the
/// character based on its script, ensuring proper rendering of various
/// writing systems. It also provides visual feedback for selection
/// states and supports touch interactions for user engagement.
///
/// Layout Structure:
/// - Left: Character symbol with script-appropriate font
/// - Center: Character name (truncated if too long)
/// - Right: Unicode code point
/// - Background: Changes color based on selection state
///
/// Font Selection:
/// - Automatically selects appropriate font based on script
/// - Falls back to system default if script-specific font unavailable
/// - Ensures proper rendering of multilingual content

  /// if it's too long to fit in the available space.

  /// This is the hexadecimal representation of the character's

  /// Examples include "U+0041" for 'A' or "U+1F600" for 'ðŸ˜€'.

  /// "Cyrillic", "Arabic", "Han", or "Emoji".

  /// receives no parameters and should handle the tap action appropriately.
