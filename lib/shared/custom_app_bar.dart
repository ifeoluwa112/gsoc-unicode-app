/// A customizable app bar widget with flexible configuration options.
///
/// The CustomAppBar widget provides a highly configurable app bar that can
/// be adapted to different screen requirements. It supports various visual
/// elements including titles, actions, leading widgets, and optional images,
/// while maintaining consistent styling with the app's design system.
///
/// This widget is designed to replace the standard Flutter AppBar in
/// situations where more customization is needed. It provides a consistent
/// look and feel across the app while allowing for screen-specific
/// customization through its extensive parameter set.
///
/// Key Features:
/// - Flexible title configuration with auto-sizing text
/// - Customizable leading widget and actions
/// - Optional image display (local assets or URLs)
/// - Consistent styling with app theme
/// - Responsive design that adapts to content
/// - Support for custom colors and padding
/// - Touch interaction handling for leading widget
///
/// Usage:
/// ```dart
/// CustomAppBar(
///   title: 'Screen Title',
///   leading: IconButton(icon: Icon(Icons.arrow_back), onPressed: () {}),
///   actions: [IconButton(icon: Icon(Icons.more_vert), onPressed: () {})],
/// )
/// ```
