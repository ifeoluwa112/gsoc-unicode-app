/// Provides a global service locator using GetIt for dependency injection.
///
/// The AppLocator class provides a centralized dependency injection system
/// for the Unicode Flutter App. It uses the GetIt package to manage
/// app-wide services, singletons, and other dependencies that need to be
/// accessible throughout the application.
///
/// This service locator pattern allows for:
/// - Centralized dependency management
/// - Easy testing through dependency injection
/// - Lazy initialization of services
/// - Singleton management for app-wide resources
/// - Clean separation of concerns
///
/// Key Features:
/// - Global access to registered services
/// - Type-safe service retrieval
/// - Lazy and eager service initialization
/// - Support for async service setup
/// - Easy mocking for testing scenarios
///
/// Usage:
/// ```dart
/// // Register a service
/// locator.registerSingleton<MyService>(MyService());
///
/// // Retrieve a service
/// final service = locator<MyService>();
///
/// // Register a factory
/// locator.registerFactory<MyService>(() => MyService());
/// ```
library;

import 'package:get_it/get_it.dart';

/// Global [GetIt.instance] for dependency injection.
///
/// This instance provides access to the global service locator that
/// manages all registered dependencies throughout the application.
/// It's used to register services during app initialization and
/// retrieve them when needed in various parts of the app.
///
/// The locator supports various registration patterns:
/// - Singleton: Single instance shared across the app
/// - Factory: New instance created each time
/// - LazySingleton: Instance created on first access
/// - Async: Services that require async initialization
///
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// // Register a service
/// locator.registerSingleton<AppRouter>(AppRouter());
///
/// // Use the service
/// final router = locator<AppRouter>();
/// ```
final GetIt locator = GetIt.instance;

/// Set up [GetIt] locator for registering services and singletons.
///
/// This function is called during app initialization to register
/// all the services, singletons, and dependencies that the app
/// needs. It provides a centralized place to configure the
/// dependency injection system.
///
/// Currently, this function is empty but can be expanded to include:
/// - Service registrations
/// - Singleton configurations
/// - Factory registrations
/// - Async service setup
/// - Environment-specific configurations
///
/// Future Implementation:
/// ```dart
/// Future<void> setUpLocator() async {
///   // Register core services
///   locator.registerSingleton<AppRouter>(AppRouter());
///   locator.registerSingleton<AppStorage>(AppStorage());
///
///   // Register BLoCs and Cubits
///   locator.registerFactory<UnicodeCharPropertiesBloc>(
///     () => UnicodeCharPropertiesBloc(),
///   );
///
///   // Register async services
///   await locator.registerSingletonAsync<DatabaseService>(
///     () async => await DatabaseService.initialize(),
///   );
/// }
/// ```
Future<void> setUpLocator() async {}
